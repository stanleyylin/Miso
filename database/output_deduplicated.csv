(with .for.insta) ... Today is the second anniversary of the viral hashtag In the last two years so many people have stood up in their own ways to declare themselves apart of the community of million of survivors of sexual violence  including sexual harassment  causing the rest of the world to finally pay attention to this public health crisis. As we move further into the election season in the U.S. we have watched the candidates elevate a number of issues that deserve attention but we have NOT heard what their plans are to deal with SEXUAL VIOLENCE both in prevention and for those who have already experienced harm. We have not seen it raised in debates or town halls or in media discussions.

Ive heard it before. But hes so nice. But she has a great family. But they volunteer for so many great organizations.

They have hobbies. They arent monsters that only come out at night. Theyre someones brother  mother  cousin  spouse  boss  nanny  friend  or doctor. Lets reframe the narrative that abusers are only capable of abuse. Because we all know theyre capable of having regular lives too.,True

EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT Laura Bates is back again with her new book  MEN WHO HATE WOMEN. For over a year has immersed herself in a terrifying and shocking world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women. In this ground-breaking investigation  Laura traces the roots of extreme misogyny across a complex network of online groups extending from Men's Rights Activists and Pick up Artists to Men Going their Own Way  Trolls and the Incel movement  in the name of which some men have committed terrorist acts. Seeing boys and men groomed and radicalised to adopt an extreme and misogynistic mindset  Laura has spent months drawing parallels with other extremist movements around the world  seeking to understand what attracts men and boys to the movement  how it operates and considers what can be done. Most urgently of all  Laura traces the pathways this extreme ideology has taken from the darkest corners of the internet to emerge covertly in our mainstream media  our playgrounds and even our parliament.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas might be a woman of steel but like everyone else  she's human too. Her struggles are for real and in the last 18 years  the actress has battled several ills in the industry to make it to the top. Today  with one foot in Bollywood and another firmly positioned in Hollywood  she's ruling the roost and how. But it wasn't anything short of a bumpy ride for her. From fighting racism in the West as a teenager to sexism here in Bollywood where PC claims she was called 'replaceable' and was thrown out of several films  Priyanka has come a long way. Talking about her entire journey  she also adds that she doesn't want to come across as a victim and it shows. Watch the full video to find out. . . . . . .,True

The house that once existed in that field was where I first felt like I was going to die. I was six. Over 30 years later I'm still here  but that house isn't. It was beautiful and in a growing neighborhood. Yet  they tore it down. I even walked around it while they were tearing it down. I felt like I had beaten the demons that were born there. There was triumph in the midst of that destruction. However  the destruction that was left in me still exists today. I have a heart damaged by abuse that started when I was a child. Through a fucked version of religion I was taught to blame myself for what was done to me. Taught that I was damaged goods. I still feel that way most days. I post this to say I am still here. Still hoping. Still striving to see something of value in me.,True

"This week we are talking about women's sexual health  as it is an important but very taboo part of women's overall wellbeing. While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men  thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff  we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming.     As women  we seem to teeter in this fine line of ""if you're not giving it up you're a prude  but if you are you're a slut"". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they're too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health  we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image  and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let's make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.   ",False

"[ - ] The tragedy started when I bought costume in the US. If you google you can find.. . So yeah  our costume was short but that doesn't justify all the sexual harassment we got here. I assure you I can tell the difference between complimenting vs harassing. (I mean  aren't we all  ladies.) I tried to just ignore it  as we came to have fun and you know I am pretty understanding of drunk people. But that French guy saying ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?"" totally brought back my worst memories in as an exchange student. I am not tokenizing all guys  and that's not the point of this posting. I want to say if you are an Asian girl traveling to countries with smaller Asian populations  prepare your own one liner. If you get harassed unexpectedly and do nothing  your brain will explode with thoughts like I should've said this  I should've said that. Although I am having fun  that moment is played over and over back of my brain  thinking what would've been the best reaction for them not to think they can do that to Asian women. So if you don't want to ruin the whole trip because of some jerks  it's good to prepare your own one liner for the worst case. And as a person who traveled to 24 countries and 56 cities in Europe  I can tell you  with a 99% chance you will thank me and yourself being prepared. My line is ""Get educated"" from now on.

Today is the 50th Anniversary of Stonewall. In a piece for It is commonly known that started with the 1969 Stonewall Inn Riots against police brutality. What is often left out of this narrative is that it was spearheaded by two transgender sex workers of colorMarsha P. Johnson & Sylvia Rivera. According to the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP)  the Stonewall Inn was commonly raided by the police because it was a notorious hangout for sex workers  trans people of color & other marginalized people.  Following the riot  Johnson & Rivera co-founded the organization Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries  a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens & trans women of color. Both of their lives were dedicated to fighting for equal rights through any means necessary.  Although she had spearheaded of the movement  Rivera had to fight to speak during a 1973 pride rally because  as Melinda Chateauvert writes in her book Sex Workers Unite  The crowd did not want to hear from a transgender sex worker. Rivera & other sex workers joined Gay Liberation Front in an attempt to create a coalition of leftist queer folk. GLF fought for the sexual revolution & an anti-capitalist agenda to combat violence & discrimination against the LGBTQ community.  In Prostitution Papers  Kate Millet writes Prostitution  homosexuality & abortion are 3 instances where the law infringed upon sexual freedom. Bringing issues together to form umbrella groups for activism is often essential in creating the space for change  as well-known trans activist wrote in her book Outspoken Full article by  launched the Sex Worker Giving Circle with the dual goal of funding a diverse range of sex worker-led groups throughout the country & bringing current & former sex workers to the philanthropic decision-making table.

The focus of this month for Jivamukti Yoga has been about silence through the exploration of this theme  at first I was thinking about how important it is that we take more time to be quiet  to be still  to say less. And then I thought about the flip side ~ when is silence... bad? There are times when we as individual people  community  society  or world are silent because we choose to stay comfortable than to speak for whats right. Watching and reading about all these horrible stories of women (mostly but not exclusively) being abused - whether physically sexually or otherwise by trusted leaders  famous singers  and even teachers in the yoga community that we look up to - and the world being silent about it for so long makes me stop and wonder. Some of the atrocities were just well hidden  yet some we knew of but just stayed idle in the hope that it would come to light on its own. And if we feel voiceless and powerless can we then hope that those in power will say and do whats right? Im not so sure. We can only trust our own voice  and speak from a place of conviction with clarity and compassion.  Thoughts?!,False

This was my ex-husband. I first discovered he was cheating on me with my bestfriend (ex) 7 yrs and 2 kids into our marriage. Before this happened to me  of course I swore if my husband ever cheated on me. I would leave him. And of course I thought about it. Even tried. But I didn't go far. He promised to stop. The affair ended with her. The cheating continued the rest of our 17 yr marriage. Sometimes he hide it better than other times. It's amazing what men can get away with when they have money  control and power. People often assume that if a man is cheating on his wife it's because they are not getting any sex from their wife. That's not true. Not with men like this. My ex-husband and I had sex on a regular basis. I wasn't allowed to say no. It was my wifely duty. It was a unspoken rule between us. The first time I resisted was on our honeymoon. I learned that night. Sexual abuse occurs regularly as a part of domestic abuse  it's just rarely discussed. There is so much shame with each topic individual  nevermind together. No still means no. Anything other than yes means no. Because it's not always possible to say no but it's damn obvious that you're not saying yes. That's sexual abuse. Which is domestic abuse.

If you are a woman  odds are that you have been slut shamed at some point in your life. I learned something that stuck with me...that everything is an act of love or a cry for love. Sexual acts definitely fall into one or both of these categories. People look for the love they need in different ways and there is nothing inherently wrong with that. So dont ever let anyone steal your self-worth. If they try to do so they were never worthy of you in the first place... .,False
"Celebrating today! . . . . ""To say the last couple of weeks around here have been intense  would be an understatement.  Has anyone else felt like this September didn't feel like a *normal* September? Instead of nestling into a cozy new routine our has felt swift  transformational  and full of discomfort and lots of learning. But all of it is teaching us and we are actively listening.   Last week we installed our very first piece of REAL food manufacturing equipment at our newest social enterprise bakery  an organization called Stone Hearth Bakery in Halifax  NS. This packaging line will be an epic timesaver and also change the look/feel of our packaging (which I admittedly have slightly mixed feelings about...but more on that later).   With these investments we are building the capacity and skills capabilities of our social enterprise partners as we all 'level up' together. Committing to growing in partnership with social enterprises as manufacturing partners is an innovative model and really we've seen  there's no existing roadmap.   It's challenging and exhilarating and seeing the impact that our partnerships have on these community-led organizations reminds that I have no interest in building this purpose-led company in any other way. Because our food's more than about the food.   We've got social impact  baked-in.""",False

Time to celebrate! After what has felt like forever ( 4 years!) The article I've been writing for has finally been submitted and submitted for pre-print. . . . I'm so proud of this achievement personally because it's been something I've been working on  on and off through bouts of illness  in between various jobs and navigating through time differences. . . . I can't tell you much about it till it's actually published but it's part of a research project into (FGS) We've also learned that this paper will be able to be citing for future funding opportunities for Bright. . . . Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic infection after malaria. It's treatment is quick  cheap and easy but it's still horribly neglected and FGS especially has been largely ignored and unknow. One can't help but wonder if this is because it affects women  and specifically women in poverty. . . . Hopefully my paper will put a dent in the education needed for healthcare staff to provide for their patients. Thank you to all my co-authors and my supervisor whose help has been invaluable and support has been amazing in moving this forward. ,False

"Last night Mr Handmade came home from work and got a text asking if he wanted to go out to play to watch the football. I could sense the fear akin to a mouse that knows he's about to become dinner for a bird of prey as he asked if I minded. In my best ""wife to be"" impression I said ""no  of course"". Silently adding on ""you've had a tough old 24 hours at work and I'm sure you're exhausted from me doing the housework  cooking  food shopping  working my own 20 hour a week job  completing Etsy orders and getting up eleventy billion times a night with a poorly 1 year old do so you go out and let your hair down"".

Secretly I didn't give two shits because I immediately had visions of a large glass of wine  my feet up  complete silence and control of the tv remote. Happy days.

Well I was going to get my hair did  new nails and rock the shiz out of London Town til dawn downing Bollinger like a dehydrated camel but unfortunately Beyonc and Gigi Hadid already have plans so....

Well  by 8pm Baby Handmade had been sick over his cot  choked on phlegm  cried his eyes out and would only settle on Mummy in Mummy's bed. So I laid there on the bed. In the dark. Dying for a drink and feeling like my bladder was having a rave up of it's own until he finally drifted off to sleep about 2 hours later. Then I went on Facebook. There must have been a lot of extra time on the football thing because Mr didn't come home until 1am .

"Rp MEAT IS MURDER  . Just some pink puppers playing in the water - Take this opportunity to reflect  and please ask yourself  ""Why do most of us believe it's okay to eat pigs  chickens  and cows  but not dogs and cats?"" All of these animals are sentient beings. All of these animals have emotions and feelings. And  most importantly  all of these animals want to be alive.  When we're new to the world and see farm animals for the first time  our initial instinct isn't to eat them; it's to pet them. Only through the repetitive teaching to view some animals as ""companion"" animals and others as ""food"" animals do we separate pigs  chickens  and cows from dogs and cats. This idea that some animals' lives matter more than others becomes engrained into our brains  but we can unlearn it if we try.

". Living in nyc this summer nearly every day  on the street or the subway  I was harrassed just for being a woman. I would often see other woman get harassed aswell. It's a lose-lose if a woman makes eye contact  or stands up for herself the losers that make women uncomfortable follow you  turn around  cuss you out  spit on you  star even more  try and intimate you even more  the list goes on some even physically assault. If you ignore it  they have the satisfaction that they made you uncomfortable  and will continually think it's okay to harass . What is it with these men who think it's okay to do that? Its literally sickening and nauseating. We are not scared we are fed up! So ya  as vulgar as it is  my hope for this piece is share the discomfort  the nauseating feeling  and the physical discomfort of being harassed based on your anatomy with those who identify with men. It's not about rage  it's to hopefully help men realize what women feel when they get harassed. I do realize men do get harassed as well  but on a whole women are far more likely to experience it regularly. So stop  it if you do. We do not think its flattering for cat calls  you turning around for a double take  the constant staring  ""looking good baby"" ""you should smile"" etc. If you wouldnt say it to your sister or brother then dont. We want to live our lives feeling safe. Heck  that's what every woman and person deserves.",False

Some BULLIES and SLUT-SHAMERS will go through entire lifetimes without ever realizing the amount of pain and damage they cause to those in the receiving end of their judgement  wicked-lies and verbal-diarrhea.

The other was for Volkswagen and featured a woman sitting next to a pram in a stereotypical care-giving role. The ads were found to have broken new advertising rules designed to reduce gender stereotyping. Both companies have defended their ads. Philadelphia described it as a ""no-win situation "" having chosen two dads to avoid the stereotypical image of two new mums handling childcare responsibilities  while Volkswagen said caring for a newborn was a life-changing experience  regardless of the parent's gender.

But we dont need feminism anymore! they say  as UK deaths by domestic violence reach an all-time high  while over 49 million girls miss out on an education in Sub-Saharan Africa  and Saudi Arabian women cannot openly compete in sport  nor wear certain clothes. The idea that women are subordinate to men has been ingrained into society from the very start  and Im beginning to understand why more and more. Im currently reading Simone de Beauvoirs The Second Sex  and  while I have a lot to criticise about her as a person  as well as her writing  its becoming increasingly obvious that womans ability to give birth somehow made them inferior. That was largely because they could not fight nor hunt  as pregnancy effectively rendered them useless  and  once the child was born  the mother had to care for it  while the father fought  defended  or scavenged for food.

Women pull up the drawbridge when they get to the top  so-called Queen Bee behaviour Not only is it harder for women to reach the top roles  theres also a tendency to judge those women who do more harshly than their male counterparts. If a fault is found in a womans leadership  its often described as typical of her gender. Yet  if she performs well  its thought of as an exception! Theres also a stigma around women exhibiting Queen Bee behaviour when they get to the top and pulling the drawbridge up for other women to succeed by turning down requests for advice and mentoring from junior women. The simple truth is that theres fewer women at the top to help the many women lower down  and its simply not possible to help them all. Whilst helping other women may be a priority for lots of female leaders  we need to remember that they also have perform well at their own job  particularly given this greater scrutiny. . . .,False

"Exactly one year ago today  Tuesday  October 16 at around I was assaulted and raped in my apartment. The fear  shame  self-hatred  depression and suicidal thoughts that accompany such a thing are indescribable. It didnt take long at all for me to reach the lowest point in my life. Too many nights  alone in the same apartment that the attack happened  I would find myself praying to God  asking Him to end my life  because I knew I couldnt bring myself to do it  but I just couldnt see any way to come back from such a thing. I. Hated. Me. Have you ever felt that way? I wanted to give up  but He wouldnt let me. He blessed me with an incredible support system of friends and family who listened to me scream and cry and doubt and hope  all in the same breath. Two months later  I decided enough was enough. God had been taking me on a journey of learning how to love myself for the last two years  and I finally decided that instead of letting this rape consume my life and define me  I was going to learn from it. I was going to grow from it. I was going to thrive. Shaving off my hair was the easiest and best decision ever. I knew I had nothing left to lose  but so much to gain  from letting go of all of my insecurities and hangups  and letting God really teach me how to love myself. Today  Im not perfect. There are days that I still look in the mirror and hate who and what I see. Im still insecure. But I love myself more today than I did last year. I love myself more today than I did yesterday. And I know God is more than satisfied with that.  If you have ever gone through anything like this  ever had thoughts like this  or just need someone to talk to - Im someone! I am here to listen  judgement free. I wont even offer any advice unless you ask. If you'd rather not talk to me  you can text ""HOME"" to 741741 to text with a trained crisis counselor  or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Just know that you dont have to go through this alone; Id love to be there for you.",False

Ask yourself why youre so concerned with my nudity and why you feel as though it is an advertisement asking for your unsolicited opinions and dick pics. Also why is it a strictly sexual act to be nude or to show your body in an appealing way? Women are punished and interrogated solely for being women and having a body.

"Shannon Maley had a seeming vendetta against a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities who was dating her sister. She barely knew him  yet claimed he sexually assaulted her and her friends. Maley then created multiple social media accounts under the young mans name and sent herself disturbing and threatening messages in order to frame him. She has since pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and also to harassing witnesses  The Daily Record  a UK news publication reports. The young man  who will not be named by because he is the victim and will instead be referred to as John Doe  told the Record he was on the brink of suicide until he was acquitted last November on five charges of sexual assault. The outlet reported that he sat on the ledge of his 14th-storey flat window seriously contemplating whether life was worth living because of the vicious lies that had destroyed him. Maleys messages to herself included threats to set you on fire and watch you burn alive and claims that John was not going to stop causing you pain. Maley had apparently intimidated her friends into making accusations against John as well. One of those friends eventually admitted that the young man had not sexually assaulted her and that Maley had harassed her and tried to influence their testimony at John's trial. John was also accused of sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls who were also allegedly friends of Maley. A witness explained that John didnt do what he was accused of doing  leading to acquittal on those charges. Maleys story unraveled after she accused John of sending a threatening message while he was in prison without access to the Internet. No reason has been given for Maleys vendetta against John  and the young man still fears for his safety. ""It feels like Shannon Maley has destroyed my life. I still cant walk down the street without people shouting abuse at me  John said. Ive had voicemails from people I dont even know saying theyre going to blow up my house. Unfortunately  people believe what they see online and its a very dangerous situation. She's an absolute monster. I want to see her punished for ruining my life.""",False

Stop calling me a nurse. Stop stereotyping on the basis of sex. Stop assuming the role of women in the workplace. Stop undermining my rights to have a career of my choice. Just stop.   Let me just tell you truthfully  there hasnt been a single day in the last two weeks that Ive been in the OR where I havent been called a nurse. The worse part is  when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident  the shock on their face is even more offensive. Dont get me wrong  I would be honored to be a nurse  its one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so its not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a doctor  is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether youre a doctor  PA  nurse  pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a when you see discrimination  of any kind  say something and leave a lasting impression. Heres what I mean  in dental school  I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled  and said no I am a dentist and then moved on. I didnt feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel its on the basis of gender  I smile  say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isnt to fight with everyone  its to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something. And guess what  everyone has a role to play whether youre a man or woman.,False

Pssst... We are a week from Musings of a Fat  Black Muslim  hitting bookstore shelves  sent to your home  and just getting to see your beautiful faces at these events. People keep asking me how do I feel about all of this  ya know having my deep dark secrets out in full view? To be honest  as I am excited  I am equally terrified. There are topics in the book that Ive never shared with the public. And especially as a Muslim woman  we are to remain pure in the public eye. We are to be covered and devout and quiet and non-sexual. We are never to taint what the world views as a perfect practicing Hijabi. We arent afforded mistakes. But men get oh  boys will be boys and 99 excuses for their fuckery. One of the topics I cover is sexuality and virginity. I wont give anything away  but I was extremely uncomfortable writing some of these stories. I couldnt get out of my head  that Im going to hell for sharing these things as a Muslim woman. It has been etched into my head that Muslim women just dont explore or talk about sexuality  among other things. We are to stay naive. Even now  Im not sure how I will prepare myself for the onslaught of negativity that this topic in particular will get from the Muslim community. I cant stress this enough  Im not the poster child for Islam. Yes  Im Muslim but I dont speak for all Muslims. Nor are we one size fits all. Why do women have to play the pious virgin role in order to not be deemed as that kind of girl? Have you ever felt like if you go against a certain aspect of your religion or culture that you would go to hell? All religions (or non) can chime in. *Also  the winners of the book giveaway are  DM meeeee!,False

Link in bio Remember the kind of political/societal excerpts we come across when we read books written by decent authors  the kind that no matter if written in the 1800's or 1700's are somehow still relevant. The sense of sadness  hopelessness and disgust they bring you. The kind that makes you want to go out and do something about the way society and politics work. You get all excited for some time but in the end you boil down to a realisation that if you go too deep and too honest  you might end up dead  just like Lankesh  Vemula and other unsung martyrs. So you calm the fuck down and let things be. I've been this person at times  at times not. I keep trying to muster up enough courage and speak up for things. It's just sad that this video might stay relevant for a long time in the history of women as well. So we've got to stay together in this fight  make regular minor changes and at times some major ones if you think you're standing for what's right. Shot and edited by my favorite,False

Ive recently come to fully accept another part of my infinite my freakiness/sexuality. I honestly always had the freak streak in me and sometimes showed it but I found myself occasionally being ashamed of being public with it due to fear of others judgment. Friends  family members and strangers would question me or place judgment on things that werent really their business to begin with. (Go find my poem  my body is not your body.) With guys it always kills me because many of our fave artists are very sexual; Im sure Ferg aint the only one who want to eat Rih-rih like a panini  yet yall will slut-shame a girl you know from done the street if she expresses herself as a savage. Either way  as someone who experienced sexual trauma and had to personally deal with the guilt and pain that comes with it YEARS after  I realize now that I dont need to give two shits anymore lol. If Im a freak  a hoe  or a tease because I like to proudly show this temporary temple off then fuck it. Bite me  That being said I usually gladly share this side of myself with the person Im with. Although Im not with anyone this was written for one person in particular . I may or may not share with him lol ...but what you think?

Amazing Winter 2019 cover by .... I like how clever this cover is. Brutally honest. Are we the land of the free... what? - Speech? No - Decisions over your body? No .... Seems that we are using the term free for the wrong subjects. Free hatred. Free racism. Free sexism. Free speech is only used when we want to oppress someone but not as a shield against injustice. .... This image does not only talk about the movement it talks about our society nowadays. .... What are your thoughts when you see this post? It is fair that a company like that sexualize the womens bodies is ambassador of this movement?

"What is a ""thirst trap""..... The confidence of a woman in her sexual frequency and sharing that with the world..? Let's think about this for a second... The thirst is coming from the other person who is seeking to find something specific within that particular person right? They are thirsty for something.. Usually this saying is all around sex... However it could be deeper than that... which is usually always is... So let's address the word.. ""trap"".... The way this is stated is that the woman who is embodying her sexuality  sexiness  sensuality  and confidence thru her physical expression is only doing so to attract someone to her.. or.... lure him to her web... (Exhibition or validation.. an episode I'm working on for the show) The evil sexually empowered woman... (Lilith running thru me) ... CAUSING the man to take his eyes away from his current partner (witch wound and the illusion of ""mine"" is an upcoming episode on Rising Goddess Radio).. taking something from another and trapping it in her web of sexual prowess.... Slut.. Whore.. Skank.. Bitch.. ... interesting... So ultimately calling someone a ""thirst trap"" is another form of slut shaming  because you (proverbial you who is calling people this based off their choices of sexually empowered photos) are seeing something within them that triggers fear of loss.. OR... if you are the person who is ""thirsty""... calling this person who is trapping you with their thirst  the problem  and ultimately not having to take responsibility for the triggered emotions and thought processes and actions coming from that trigger.... ... interesting... What are your thoughts? Oh! And to summer... because I'm traveling back to Aurora in a week  and it's snowing... Soooo.... sunlight and warmth and string bikinis... Cause . . .",False

It is a matter of great shame that cases of female infanticide are still reported. We want to be a part of a world where girls are celebrated  not just on festivals!

NEWS! MEN WHO HATE WOMEN  out May 2020. The past year of my life has been consumed by a project that has felt urgent  terrifying and shocking. It has been really strange to be immersed in a world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women  to see boys being deliberately groomed and radicalised and to trace the ideology and messaging I was finding deep online right through our mainstream and media and into our politics and homes  all without much mainstream awareness at all that this is happening. Im both excited and scared about this book coming out and will really appreciate any support as I am already starting to experience what I know will be a massive backlash from the communities this book aims to expose. If you think you might like to read it  pre-orders make a massive difference to authors as they help persuade booksellers to stock the book - link in my bio,False

Might delete this later-but I've been thinking about sharing my story/letting people know about my experience. My 'first time' was very unfortunate and my choices were taken away from me as I was assaulted in my own bed right before I graduated high school. He held me down and forced himself inside me leaving me with bruises. I was shocked and didn't know what to do feeling violated and as though he had already taken something away from me. He proceeded to FINALLY put on protection and finish regardless of me not looking at him the entire time. I put it out of my mind thinking that I was overreacting and he didnt mean anything malicious by it. All that changed when I had learned he was telling my recent ex of a year that he had finally gotten what my ex had never had. I heard about it from multiple people and was so distraught. I have felt so guilty for not having said something/done something for so long. I only recently told my mother of what happened. I only have one thing left to say  and FUCK YOU.,False

"""Tagging"" or ""tag"" has its origins in ancient Rome  where members of all-female communities  such as priestesses in the temples of one goddess or another  attached scriptures to each other's robe indicating the alleged value of the person wearing it in the eyes of the divinity served.

VENT INCOMING . . . Self censorship brought to you by Instagram  but truly enforced by societies fucked up ideals! Sometimes I feel absolutely invisible only up and to the point of objectification. Censorship takes a toll on your psych  on your physical wellbeing. As sex workers we are constantly excluded from conversations about our work and as human beings we are othered and aliened from general society. . . Even as said society worships our ideals  I find myself exhausted and run down more than I care to admit. Shame  stigma  fear  violence all of the destructive and abusive interactions can be boiled down to the fact that we do not allow ourselves to have a nuanced perspective on our own sexuality. We project! We Attack those we wish to emulate! I cant even count how many times I was taught and did enforce sexism and self censorship myself in my younger days. . . My sexuality and my body (nude or not) gives me strength  and power  and people seek out my time to bask in that energy. Constantly making me censor my own body only reminds me of how dangerous the world sees me. This fear allows them to take away our rights and demonize our actions while they continue to see us in private.

Lindy West (Author of Shrill  The Witches are Coming) for Seattle Magazine 2013. This photo was taken five years before the movement. Lindy was a fresh and unrelenting voice for womens issues. Her public denouncing of rape as comedic subject matter elevated her name into the national arena  if she liked it or not. It was at that time that I witnessed a peek into Lindy's world. She had just returned to Seattle from being invited to participate in a nationally televised debate on the matter. A debate that resulted instantly in rape  violence and death threats from faceless commenters. I will never forget how raw and resolute she was as she read them aloud to us that night. In that moment  I saw a Joan of Arch-type heroine in Lindy. I was so enamored with her strength and inspired by her defiance to be silenced. When told I was to photograph her for the magazine  this concept came naturally.,False

MeToo has been ongoing in the acts of supporting and speaking about her sexual violences. 98% of sexual violence are committed by men.

Are you able to identify your strengths? Understanding your personal potential is essential to your success. If you cant identify your own strengths  its more difficult to identify new roles youd be a great fit for  or to explain at an interview why youd make a great asset to the team. A good starting point can be analysing your CV  although you need to go beyond this to articulate your potential. Heres a couple of questions to think about When you look at your achievements and you think about the way you went about securing those things  what does it tell you about what you do well? From those insights  what does that indicate are the most important aspects of your skills  knowledge  approach(es) that make the difference that you deliver? Whats your supporting evidence? Underpinning those achievements  in terms of delivering your role  what is it about your attitude  outlook and behaviours that made those outcomes possible? . . .,False

If you cant convince yourself  you cant convince others Theres a lot of talk about confidence  but for a good its one of the most fundamentally significant concepts for women in the workplace. If you do not (at least) appear to have confidence in what you say  do  suggest or recommend  why should anyone else? Our 2019 survey results found that whilst 81.1% of women felt that always or mostly demonstrated external confidence  only 47% matched this with strong internal confidence. Whilst its brilliant that women are resilient enough to present a confident faade  some of their potential will undoubtably be lost due to this lack of self-belief. To change things we have to address the cause  not the symptoms. These internal confidence issues are caused by external biases which eclipse the truth about individual womens capability potential. By using psychological insights  we want to expose these limiting beliefs and enable all women to unlock their full potential. Is your internal confidence holding you back? . . .,False

// Follow Follow Slut - A word used by boys to describe a girl's character these days She wears short clothes  she is a slut! She is going for a late night party  she is a slut! She is talking with more than one guy  she is a slut! She is not a virgin  she is a slut! She is having more male friends  she is a slut! And now a days  even if a girl is wearing an off shoulder top  you guys label her as a slut! She is not a slut...Come on every one is having freedom to live.. Rather I should say that your minds are filled with dirt. Everytime when a girl decides to live her life in her own way  she is labelled as a slut by some knuckleheads. STOP THIS SLUT SHAMING Do you guys ever realise how bad a girl feels  when she is called a Slut? Just because she wanted to live her life freely? Life seems meaningless to her. She regrets being born as a girl. .I want you to know that you are beautiful no matter what others say to you. No one deserves to feel even for a second that they are worthless in this world. Never give anyone the ability to bring you down or allow you to think you are not good enough. Each and every one of us were placed on this Earth with a purpose...No one can heal themselves by wounding others. Our words must be used to encourage others  not destroy them. We do not know the struggles and hardships others may be experiencing. It is important to always be mindful of the feelings of others. Do not be afraid to be yourself because that is what makes you special. You can achieve anything you set your mind to. This is your life  it is up to you to paint it the way you would like it to be  So Dear Girls  Don't hold back your feelings and awesomeness just because of some cheap and mentally disturbed craps...Don't just walk away  just give them a tight slap give that person a nice lesson  lets your hands do the talking and at last just ask a question...Ghar meh maa behan nai hai kya ? // .

Reporting your abuser is a very scary decision. Its not for everyone. But if the reason thats holding you back from reporting is because youre worried about hurting your abuser  then I want you to know this. Youre not ruining their life. Abusing someone is a choice. Its a choice that should come with consequences just like any other action. Youre not ruining their reputation or destroying their friendships. If anything  youre letting others see that person for who they really are. You might even find others join you in saying . That was certainly the case for me. And despite what their supporters may say  what youre doing is incredibly brave. Youre helping yourself. Youre helping other survivors. And youre making your community safer.

He chose to hurt me. And hopefully  he wont hurt anyone else.,False

Heres an illustration By Imogen - In light of the recent 2 year anniversary of the . Everyday people are putting their hands up  Bravely telling their stories in hope that it might encourage others to share their experiences  by using the hashtag people are beginning to get a sense of the magnitude of the problem and it also gives victims a platform to speak openly and safely in hope that others will join the fight to end sexual violence. For some survivors telling their story is a radical act of healing if their reality has been denied or they have been conditioned to protect the feelings of another at the expense of there own. Survivors own their stories and with that they have the right to choose to withhold or share them The unfortunate truth is that most people who do come forward are subjected to further feelings of shame by being dismissed  their motives  actions questioned and worried that our untold stories will invite disapproval and victim blaming/shaming. Regardless of how our stories differ  our experiences are our own  we have all endures something that never should have happened to us  this is the connection we share. No matter what we will continue to believe all survivors- period. I see you & I believe you.,False

Im with you.  Natasha // Upstate NY | Ive thought a lot about whether of not to post this story  but  I think its important. So  fuck it. Heres the story Natashas Photo. Natasha is my Godsister. I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field  listening to music  shooting  talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world  not performing for any gaze  but rather  celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned  and then outraged  especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own  but naked women posing for men are fine  but this image  this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful  unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. Its been that way ever since. Now  I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I dont particularly care. However  Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not  as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions. So  Im calling you out Instagram. Im not the only one youve buried. And Im tired of you telling me what I want to see in my timeline  because your algorithm sucks. If I follow someone  I want to see their images  not the same 5 people and nobody else. Show me my damn friends and stop making women feel like only images a frat boy would wanna jerk off to is what the beauty standard of a woman should be.,False

Did you ask for her social afterwards?,False
This doesn't look like a success.... Regardless of whether she has a bf or not she is not interested. You should of dropped it and not insist that is creepy. She didn't even wanted to be friends so i don't see the point here. She probably just wanted another Instagram follower and hoped you won't bother her lol.,False
Its a success regardless because he tried. People are way too tied into results. Once he does this enough he will get there,False
It isnt success if trying is overridden by being creepy. Yes there is an effort but in a bad sense ,False
Asking to have coffee as friends is not unhealthy or insisting. Who knows how she felt about it. Clearly this is a starting point. Its better than not doing anything and sitting around wondering what wouldve happened. Yes this wasnt a good approach to it and I always think connecting with a girl on a human level must come first before asking them out,False
Look I am okay with trying cold approach that is good practice nothing wrong with that. However if you turn interactions to this it would not go anywhere and you mess up all the effort you put. You basically can cut it when you supposed to and don't leave other party in stress and don't waste time yourself. Simple as that. This is bad for both parties. Asking a coffee as a friend is just plain lie and both parties know about it. So let's pass that.,False
What part of it is creepy? He just did 2 questions. How is that insisting dude?,False
Yeah I mean trying and such as I said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster. However being pushy just spoils that. It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to. Plus girls care a lot about Instagram followers these days ( lame but true ). Anyway OP try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people's boundaries please.,False

I don't see body-neutrality advancing catching traction as quickly as I hoped it would. Our feminists also seem to recognise only the sexist aspect of lookism. Maybe I'm too quiet,True

It's just true cumbrain nature being expressed. All males have a primitive hatred for ugly women.

But some are sexually frustrated because they can't get the 7/10 they want and are forced to settle for a 6.5. Those guys feel the need for an outlet for their frustration online. It's telling just how much of online content is dedicated to scrutinizing women's facial bones and the size of the fat sacks on their chest. Truly the rational sex,False

I would interject. When people encounter any conflict they often consider the person who brought it up the person who caused it. When you bring it up itll make you be seen as the cause of the drama for bringing it up shielding the victim of the behaviour from backlash for defending herself.

Im not sure if Im looking at this too simplistically but its often touted that the legal system and laws are part of the patriarchy. Ive heard several times before that these laws are written and often enforced by men for their benefit. In spite of this there is disparity between the sentencing of men and women in federal causes.

Are you familiar with [the patriarchal bargain](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Patriarchal_bargain)?,False
When youre stuck inside patriarchy participating in it can protect you and reward you in some limited ways. Women sometimes laugh at sexist jokes because challenging them would be socially dangerous and sometimes physically dangerous. Women sometimes support abusers over victims because those abusers hold more social capital than their victims. This is an extreme example but consider Harvey Weinstein - the few women who did report him early on lost their careers because of the power he held in the film industry. Other actresses who *definitely* were aware of his behavior continued to work with him because if they also spoke out about it theyd be blacklisted as well.

I totally understand what you feel. But its also important to realise that intersectionality in feminism is so important. The fact that we mostly read and discuss Western feminism is a part of the post colonial discourse. There is a still a soft culture in academia about the Western understanding of feminism.

What is the line between being a girlfriend and being a wife?Part of using the red pill dating strategy is to marry someone who values you as the woman you are and to keep that marriage healthy and happy. Something I've noticed though is women acting like a wife when they are only a girlfriend which only gives a man more reason not to marry. What do you think is the difference between being a girlfriend and being a wife is? What behaviors should a wife do but not a girlfriend as to not give too much to a man who hasnt fully committed to her yet? I am sure there are many different answers for different women even within this community. As someone who is a girlfriend and not quite a wife Im interested in what you ladies think.,False

Bald men can be sexy. My partner is bald and I wouldnt wish for him to change.  Baldness is a sign of high testosterone.       But personality is important.

If youre going to live a long time with someone and spend every day with them wouldnt you want them to have a shining personality and not be weird or ruin things with their constant unneeded insecurity?

Does anyone else have a hard time feeling empathy/sympathy for people who have committed sex crimes?I've recently decided I want to become a prisoner penpal (basically you write letters back forth with someone who is incarcerated and offer them friendship since many inmates lose contact with the outside) and in my research to find an inmate I feel comfortable writing letters to I'm discovering that I have a hard time feeling sorry for people who've been convicted of sex crimes relative to other serious crimes.

Guys like to test relationship out not in a bad way but just to see if it will last. For example my boyfriend just recently started to tell his family about me even though weve been dating for 2 years and I completely understand that it takes time to vet a potential spouse. Also are you withholding sex because you feel like it will give you more power or an upper hand the the relationship?

You right that can put u in the wrong place but i have to say this not every girl the same some u have to move directly to the relationship zone others it would be better to be in the FZ first and that cool guy is because he already build a reputation of being that cool with girls.

Its just a himan nature when u see many people trying to get something or being around someone its just get us to think that thing or person must be great or cool for those many people to want him.,False
Thats a great point actually im glade someone did say that. But about that statement i think it sould hold true for some of the guys here that only want one night thing or just sex.

Men don't approach anymore ...I hear this quite often by women complaining they don't get approached and it begs the question: are men that bad today?
